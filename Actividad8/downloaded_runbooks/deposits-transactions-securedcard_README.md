# Deposits Transactions Secured Card Service

This service manages secured card transactions, vault balances, and auto-funding functionality for the Stori platform. It provides a RESTful API for handling various operations related to secured cards, including balance management, transaction history, and automated funding.

## Service Overview

The Deposits Transactions Secured Card service is built using Go and follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains business models and interfaces
- **Application Layer**: Implements business logic and use cases
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Handles HTTP routing, middleware, and external service integrations
- **Adapters Layer**: Provides implementations for external services and validators

## Architecture

The service is deployed on AWS using the following components:

- **ECS (Elastic Container Service)**: Hosts the application containers
- **NLB (Network Load Balancer)**: Distributes incoming traffic
- **DynamoDB**: Stores transaction and auto-fund data
- **Lambda**: Integrates with core banking systems
- **SNS**: Handles event publishing
- **CloudWatch**: Provides logging and monitoring

## Configuration

The service requires the following environment variables:

- `SERVICE_NAME`: Name of the service
- `ENV_STAGE_NAME`: Environment stage (dev, staging, prod)
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region
- `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`: AWS account ID
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level
- `ECS_TASK_DEF_NAME`: ECS task definition name
- `PORT`: Container port
- `TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE`: Trace sampling rate
- `MOVEMENTS_CORE_LAMBDA_NAME`: Lambda function for core banking movements
- `SECURED_CARD_USER_TYPE`: User type for secured cards
- `INTERNAL_BASE_URL`: Internal base URL
- `EVENT_TOPIC_ARN`: SNS topic ARN for events
- `FRAUD_LAMBDA`: Lambda function for fraud detection
- `FRAUD_VERIFICATION_FLAG`: Flag for fraud verification
- `DYNAMO_TRANSACTIONS_TABLE`: DynamoDB table for transactions
- `DYNAMO_AUTO_FUND_TABLE`: DynamoDB table for auto-funding

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.19 or higher
- Docker
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up environment variables (copy from `.env.example` and modify as needed)
3. Run `make dev` to start the service locally

### Deployment

Use the provided deployment scripts to build and deploy the service to AWS:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter the following error while running `make dev`:

```
Error saving credentials: error storing credentials â€“ err: exec: "docker-credential-desktop": executable file not found in $PATH
```

You may need to clear up your existing docker store credential configurations. To fix it, remove the credStore section from the config file:

```json
{
  //remove this line
  "credsStore": "docker-desktop"
}
```

## GitHub Actions

In order to execute GitHub Actions in this repository, you will need to create a DevOps ticket requesting to add the **GitHub Actions Token**. Without this token, the test runner does not run correctly and the linter will fail if using libraries like `stori-utils-go`. This is important because you won't be able to merge into **main** due to branch protection.

## Warnings

AWS components do not support names with more than 32 characters. Be careful when naming your stack/service since stack-name and service-name are used for setting the name of the resources created by the template.
